bazaar
======

My Racket personal library of useful or generic commands.
Intended as a convenience for other projects, but is unstable and may change without notice.

After some time, some features may be extracted/deprecated from `bazaar` and turned into a proper package. 

If there's a feature you like particularly and you'd want it to be more stable, documented and more thoroughly tested, please start an issue to say so.
